I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University, advised by Prof. Yuchao Yang and Prof. Bonan Yan. I received B.S. at Peking University in 2021.

Interests
======
My research focuses on emerging memory design, novel hardware accelerators, neuromorphic computing, and efficient graph processing. I have 13 published/accepted papers, including 6 as the first or co-first author, in top-tier journals and conferences such as **Nature Electronics** (IF=33.7) and **Nature Communications** (IF=14.7). With a strong foundation in both industry and academia, I interned at a startup, where I independently tested and validated the functionality of an SRAM-based in-memory computing chip. During my time at university, I designed, taped out, and successfully tested an RRAM-based in-memory computing chip from scratch, demonstrating my ability to independently lead complex hardware projects.
